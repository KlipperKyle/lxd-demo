4 What is LXD not?
==================

  + It is not full virtualization.  A guest does not have a kernel!  If
    you want to run Windows, BSD, or something else, then use libvirt
    and virt-manager.
  + It is not for application-specific containers (i.e. Docker,
    Kubernetes-like, CNCF, or alphabet soup compliant)

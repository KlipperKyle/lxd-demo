1 What is LXD?
==============

  LXD is a management daemon for LXC containers (a.k.a. Linux-native
  containers).  An LXC container is a chroot on steroids: extra
  namespace isolation.

  See <https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/>

  Note: all commands that start with `lxc-' (e.g. `lxc-create') belong
  to the original LXC.  This is the older containerization suite.  LXD
  supersedes it.

  Put another way: LXD is to LXC as Libvirt is to QEMU.

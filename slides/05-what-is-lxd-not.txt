5 What is LXD not?
==================

  + LXD is not full virtualization.  If you need to run something other
    than Linux (e.g. Windows, BSD, or Plan 9), then use libvirt and
    virt-manager.
  + LXD is not for application-specific containers (i.e. Docker,
    Kubernetes-like, CNCF, or alphabet soup compliant).  If you donâ€™t
    have `/sbin/init', then LXD will complain.
